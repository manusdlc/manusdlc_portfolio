                Hola, I'm Manu <br/> 
                <br />
                I studied Statistics and Computer Science and now I build software at Amazon (in Toronto). <br/>
                <br />
                I like computing. Sometimes I dislike computers. I make them do cool stuff:
            </div>
        </section>
    );
}

export default Intro;
